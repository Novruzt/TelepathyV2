# TelepathyV2

TelepathyV2 is a complete rewrite of the original Telepathy mod for Mount & Blade II: Bannerlord.

The mod allows you to talk to heroes remotely without needing to meet them in person on the campaign map.  
It includes all functionality of the original Telepathy mod, along with additional improvements and new features.

TelepathyV2 is written from scratch and designed to be lightweight, configurable, and compatible with other gameplay mods.

## Compatibility & Load Order

TelepathyV2 does **not** hard-depend on other gameplay mods.

If you are using mods that provide similar features like remote talk (e.g. Diplomacy):

**Make sure TelepathyV2 is loaded *after* those mods in the mod load order**,  
otherwise the mod may not activate.
